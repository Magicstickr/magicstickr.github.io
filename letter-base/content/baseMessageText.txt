My dear Satsuki, 

My sweet love, I shall wait patiently till tomorrow before I
see you, and in the mean time, if there is any need of such a 
thing, assure you by your Beauty, that whenever I have at 
any time written on a certain unpleasant subject, it has 
been with your welfare impress’d upon my mind. How hurt 
I should have been had you ever acceded to what is, 
notwithstanding, very reasonable! How much the more do I 
love you from the general result! In my present state of 
Health I feel too much separated from you and could 
almost speak to you in the words of Lorenzo’s Ghost to 
Isabella 

‘Your Beauty grows upon me and I feel A greater love
through all my essence steal.’ 

My greatest torment since I have known you has been the 
fear of you being a little inclined to the Cressid; but that 
suspicion I dismiss utterly and remain happy in the surety 
of your Love, which I assure you is as much a wonder to me 
as a delight. Send me the words ‘Good night’ to put under 
my pillow.
