In the world today
Chinese 
Are people 
Who live in China

On the local scene 
chinese
are adjectives
that modify people
Passport problems
Certain Scandianvians bow and speak japanese to 
me although I am not japanese

Travelling in Europe if treated as a forighner I 
Simply switched countries, but this time I have 
come to stay and tire of these strange curiosities and disdain 

I crave their pigments to darken, for a sudden 
Blooming of Asian eyes, to soften their high curved 
cheekbones, their European angles

Chirstmas holidays they stop me at the border and 
examine my passport with ultraviolet rays: 

"There are many forged passports lately Canadian 
passports, many Asians, using forged Canadian passports

"There are Asians living in Canada" The border 
guard replie defensly "I know"
